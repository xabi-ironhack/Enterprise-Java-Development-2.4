# Lab 2.4
Labs are mandatory and must be completed before the start of the next class.

You make work collaboratively with your classmates, but you may not copy and paste another students code.

## Instructions
Create a new github repository named Enterprise-Java-Development-2.4

Add your instructor and the class graders to your repository and ensure that your repository is private. Public repositories will receive a zero on the assigment.

If you are unsure who your class graders are, ask your instructor or refer to the day 1 slide deck.

Upload the code for all of the following prompts to your repository.

## Specifications
1. Create a Person class that has properties id, name, age, and occupation. Throw an error if someone tries to set age to less than 0. Include all tests.

2. Create an array or List of Person objects. Create a findByName method. The method should take in a String name and return the Person with a name that matches exactly. The Person name property and the method name parameter should be formatted as "firstName lastName". Throw an exception if the name parameter is not properly formatted. Include all tests.

3. Create a clone method. The clone method should take in a Person object and return a nearly identical object with new id. Override the equals method in the Person class to test for equivalency excluding id. Include all tests.

4. Create a method that takes a Person object as a parameter and used the toString method to write the Person information to a file. Handle any errors as necessary.
